Project : Bike Buyers Analysis

Understanding the Dataset:
The dataset contains information about individuals, including demographics, income, and purchasing behavior (whether they purchased a bike or not).

Steps Performed:

1.Data Cleaning:
Checked for missing or inconsistent values in columns such as Income, Gender, and Purchased Bike.
Standardized categorical values (e.g., ensuring Yes/No responses are consistent).

2.Data Transformation:
Created new calculated columns, such as Income per Car (for income divided by the number of cars owned).
Grouped data by regions (e.g., Europe, Pacific) to analyze regional trends.

3.Visualization and Insights:
Used pivot tables to analyze relationships between demographics and bike purchases.
Created charts to show trends, such as the impact of Income and Commute Distance on purchasing behavior.

4.Outcome:
Identified key customer profiles likely to purchase bikes, such as those with higher income, fewer cars, and shorter commutes.
